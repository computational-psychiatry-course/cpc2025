## About the CPC
The Computational Psychiatry Course (CPC) is organized since 2015 by the [Translational Neuromodeling Unit (TNU)](https://www.tnu.ethz.ch/), University of Zurich & ETH Zurich, and is designed to provide students from different fields with the necessary toolkit to master challenges in computational psychiatry research. The CPC is meant to be practically useful for students at all levels (MDs, Master, PhD, Postdoc, PI) and from diverse backgrounds (neuroscience, psychology, medicine, engineering, physics, etc.), who would like to apply modeling techniques to study cognition or brain physiology in mental health. The course will teach not only the theory of computational modeling, but also demonstrate open-source software in application to example data sets.

## Main Course
The slides of the main course lectures can be found in the  ``main-course`` folder. Whether slides will be uploaded or not depends on the preferences of the speakers, so you might not find slides for all talks.

## Tutorials
Check out the tutorial material under ``tutorials``. Additionally, you can find installation guides for required software installation for each tutorial in the folder ``installation-guides``.
