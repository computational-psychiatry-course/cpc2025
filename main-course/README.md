# CPC Zurich 2025 - Main Course

The main course takes place from Monday to Friday and aims to provide an in-depth introduction to computational psychiatry and related concepts, with a focus on Bayesian modeling concepts. We try to make slides and code shown during the talks accessible to everyone here, according to the preference of the speakers. 

## Main Course Structure
``Day-1`` covers topics in Psychiatry providing a conceptual basis for the type of questions that Computational Psychiatry needs to address.

``Day-2`` explains basic modeling principles (basic mathematical terminology, step-by-step guide on how to build a model, model fitting and model selection) and finishes with a first introduction to models of perception (Psychophysics, Bayesian Models of Perception).

``Day-3`` continues with reinforcement learning, models of perception (Predictive Coding), an introduction to the HGF (hierarchical Gaussian filter), action selection (Markov Decision Processes, Active Inference, Drift Diffusion Models) and ends with an introduction to models of metacognition.

``Day-4`` includes models of brain connectivity (Dynamic Causal Modeling for fMRI and EEG and biophysical network models) and Machine Learning (basics and advanced).

``Day-5`` features a series of talks on practical applications of computational models to problems from Psychiatry.
